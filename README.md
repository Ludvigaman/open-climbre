# Climber
Climber is a free to use application that lets you create a web-application for your climbing club or center. 
With Climber, you can register routes, keep scores and let users create their own profiles; to keep track of what routes they've mastered.

This project is done for fun, to allow myself and my gym to skip all expensive alternatives that provide the same functionality for a price of around 50-150â‚¬ a month. 

# Maintenance
I don't know how much I'll work on this application once it's done, but if you find something wrong or a bug; add an issue here on GIT and I'll look into it asap :)
